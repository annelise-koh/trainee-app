                I'm keen to both learn from and work with others 🤓
                TP sounds like a good chance to gain experience in 
                collaborative programming! <br>

                I make some fire PowerPoints 😼
                and think I can do similar design stuff in web dev, 
                but at this stage my creativity is 
                limited by my skills/experience

              <h2>three.</h2>
              <p>
                I just think the training program is a very cool opportunity <br>
                to become a better student, programmer and <br>
                subbie 🐐

    <section id="section-theme" class="section theme">
        <h2>i know what you're thinking ⁉️</h2>
        <p>how does this relate to 'opposites attract'??<br>
        <br>
        i would argue that soufflé pancakes are a <br>
        culinary representation of opposites attracting ☝️☝️ <br>
        with the opposites in question being East and West ! <br>
        since soufflé pancakes are a Japanese adaptation <br>
        of a Western breakfast staple <br>
        <br>
        
        mostly i just wanted to figure out how to <br>
        use this 3d model in a website. hope this <br>
        counts as adhering to the theme though pls
